The initial cost of planting the tree is $90.\n2. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each. So, the total revenue from selling lemons per year is:\n7 lemons/year \u00d7 $1.5/lemon = $10.50/year\n3. The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.\n4. To find the net profit per year, subtract the annual cost from the revenue:\n$10.50/year (revenue) - $3/year (cost) = $7.50/year (net profit)\n5. Since the initial cost of planting the tree is $90, Carlos needs to earn at least $90 in net profit to break even.\n6. To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn $90 in net profit, divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:\n$90 \u00f7 $7.50/year = 12 years\n\nTherefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.\n"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with \"x\". So, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n2. She had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house.\n3. Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n4. Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of 2x/3 - 2 is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.\n5. So, she had 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house.\n6. We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation: x/3 - 1 = 5.\n7.

Since she has already walked for 1 + 1 = 2 hours, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.\n6. To find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time.\n7.

You have 15 liters of pineapple drink that is 3/5 water. To find the amount of water in the pineapple drink, multiply 15 liters by 3/5:\n\n15 liters x 3/5 = 45/5 = 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink\n\n3. You spill 1 liter of the orange drink.
