Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with \"x\". So, she sold x/3 at the green house.\n2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so now she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of what was left is (x - x/3 - 2)/2.\n4. After selling at the orange house, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5\n\nTo simplify the equation, let's first calculate the value of (x - x/3 - 2)/2:\n\n(x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1\n\nNow, substitute this value back into the equation:\n\nx - x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = 5\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx - 2x/3 - 2 - x/3 + 1 = 5\n\nCombine the x terms:\n\nx - 3x/3 - 2 + 1 = 5\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\nx - 1 - 2 + 1 = 5\n\nSimplify:\n\nx - 2 = 5\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\nx = 7\n\nSo, Melanie started with 7 vacuum cleaners.\n"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means that for every 7 units of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 units.\n2. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a constant.\n3. The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so we can set up the equation: 7x + 11x = 162\n4.

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he buys 2 x 5 = 10 red ties.\n\n3. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. This means the red ties cost 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. Since blue ties cost $40 each, the red ties cost:\n$40 x 1.5 = $60 each\n\n4. To find out how much John spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost per tie:\n10 x $60 = $600\n\n5.

This means she gets 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500/year.\n3. Since she works for 10 more years (30 - 20 = 10), she gets the standard pension for 10 years and the increased pension for 10 years.\n4. The standard pension for 10 years is $50,000/year x 10 = $500,000.\n5. The increased pension for 10 years is $2,500/year x 10 = $25,000/year.\n6. To find the total annual pension, add the standard pension and the increased pension: $500,000 + $25,000 = $525,000.\n\nSo, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of work will be $525,000/year.\n"}], "max_tokens": 10}}
