Josh buys the house for $80,000.\n2. He puts in $50,000 in repairs, which increases the value of the house by 150%.\n3. To find the new value of the house, we need to calculate 150% of the original value ($80,000) and add it to the original value.\n\n150% of $80,000 = 1.5 x $80,000 = $120,000\n\nNew value of the house = Original value + Increase in value\n= $80,000 + $120,000\n= $200,000\n\nSo, the new value of the house is $200,000.\n\nNow, let's calculate Josh's profit:\n\nProfit = Selling price - Cost\n= $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000)\n= $200,000 - $130,000\n= $70,000\n\nJosh made a profit of $70,000.\n"}], "max_tokens": 10}}

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with \"x\". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n\n2. After selling at the green house, she had x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left.\n\n3. Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.\n\n4. Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of 2x/3 - 2 is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.\n\n5. After selling at the orange house, she had 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) = x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners left.\n\n6. We are told that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in a total time of 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours.\n6.

The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. This means that for every 7 units of Darrell's age, Allen's age is 11 units.\n2.

Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.\n\nWe know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (x + 30) = 110\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x + 30 = 110\n\nSubtract 30 from both sides:\n\n2x = 80\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 40\n\nSo there are 40 silver coins.

After 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. This means her annual pension increases by 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500.\n2. So, after 20 years, Marcy's annual pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.\n3. Since she quits after 30 years, she will receive this increased pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10).\n4. To calculate the total value of the increased pension, we multiply the annual pension by the number of years: $52,500 x 10 = $525,000.\n5. Now, we need to calculate 5% of the total value of the increased pension, which is $525,000. 5% of $525,000 is $26,250.\n6. Finally, we add the increased pension to the 5% increase: $52,500 + $26,250 = $78,750.\n\nSo, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $78,750.\n"}], "max_tokens": 10}}
